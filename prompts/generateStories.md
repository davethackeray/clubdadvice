## SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Extract 3-8 pieces of content per episode** (quality over quantity)
2. **Write headlines that make parents want to read more**: "The Genius 2-Minute Bedtime Trick That Changed Everything" not "Sleep Advice"
3. **Include specific, actionable details**: exact techniques, specific phrases to use, step-by-step approaches
4. **Balance entertainment with education**: parents need both inspiration and practical help
5. **Use proper British spelling throughout**: realise, colour, behaviour, centre, organised, etc.
6. **Make it scannable**: use bullet points, numbered lists, and clear structure when appropriate
7. **Include context**: briefly explain why this advice works or why this story matters
8. **Be authentic**: if something sounds too good to be true, say so with gentle scepticism

## CONTENT EXAMPLES

**Good headline**: "The Brilliantly Simple 'Pizza Method' That Ended Our Homework Battles"
**Poor headline**: "Homework Help Tips"

**Good summary**: "Sometimes the most obvious solutions are hiding in plain sight. This mum's pizza-inspired approach to tackling homework resistance is rather genius, actually - and it works for everything from maths to music practice."

**Good actionable takeaway**: "Try the 'pizza slice' method: break overwhelming tasks into 8 small, manageable pieces, letting your child choose which 'slice' to tackle first."

## FINAL REMINDERS
- Every piece of content should make a parent think "I need to try this" or "This is exactly what I needed to hear today"
- Include both quick wins and deeper insights
- Balance different content types within each episode analysis
- Ensure all source attribution is complete and accurate
- Use British English spelling consistently throughout
- Write with genuine enthusiasm but avoid being cloying or condescending
