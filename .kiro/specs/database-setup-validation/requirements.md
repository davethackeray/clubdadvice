# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Club Dadvice application currently has database connectivity issues in the local development environment. The comprehensive test report shows that while database connection works, the core application tables (articles, age_groups, categories, tags) are missing, causing the application to fail. This feature will create a robust database setup and validation system that ensures all required database components are properly configured and tested across different environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated database setup system, so that I can quickly initialize the database schema with all required tables and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the database setup script THEN the system SHALL create all required tables (articles, age_groups, categories, tags, sources, takeaways, related_topics, and junction tables)
2. WHEN the database setup runs THEN the system SHALL populate default data for age_groups and categories
3. WHEN the setup encounters existing tables THEN the system SHALL skip creation and report existing table status
4. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN the setup completes successfully THEN the system SHALL generate a setup report with table counts and status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive testing validation system, so that I can verify all application components are working correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the validation system runs THEN it SHALL test database connectivity and table existence
2. WHEN testing the article management system THEN it SHALL verify CRUD operations work correctly
3. WHEN testing the email system THEN it SHALL validate configuration and test email sending in development mode
4. WHEN testing core pages THEN it SHALL verify all essential files exist and are accessible
5. WHEN testing security features THEN it SHALL validate CSRF protection and rate limiting functionality
6. WHEN all tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate an HTML report with pass/fail status and recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration management, so that the application works seamlessly across local development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically detect the environment (local vs production)
2. WHEN in local development THEN it SHALL use local database credentials and enable development features
3. WHEN in production THEN it SHALL use production credentials and disable development-only features
4. IF configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL prevent function redeclaration errors
5. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL load appropriate configuration without manual intervention

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migration and schema management, so that I can safely update the database structure as the application evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running migrations THEN the system SHALL track which migrations have been applied
2. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and report the error
3. WHEN adding new tables or columns THEN the system SHALL preserve existing data
4. IF migration dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL run migrations in the correct order
5. WHEN migrations complete THEN the system SHALL update the migration log with execution details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing integration, so that I can run comprehensive tests as part of the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress feedback
2. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested fixes
3. WHEN testing email functionality THEN it SHALL verify templates render correctly and logging works
4. WHEN testing article functionality THEN it SHALL verify filtering, pagination, and individual article retrieval
5. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate a success report with performance metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database health monitoring, so that I can proactively identify and resolve database issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring runs THEN it SHALL check database connection health and response times
2. WHEN checking table integrity THEN it SHALL verify foreign key constraints and indexes
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN it SHALL identify slow queries and suggest optimizations
4. IF database issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings and provide resolution steps
5. WHEN monitoring completes THEN it SHALL generate a health report with actionable insights
