# Implementation Plan

## Infrastructure Prerequisites

**CRITICAL: Complete Database Setup & Testing Validation System First**
Reference: `.kiro/specs/database-setup-validation/tasks.md`

Before implementing any features in this plan, complete the database setup and testing validation system. This foundational infrastructure ensures:
- Frictionless development across local and production environments
- Automated database schema management and migration capabilities
- Comprehensive testing framework for reliable feature development
- Performance monitoring and health checks for production readiness

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Complete tasks 1-8 from database-setup-validation spec (core infrastructure)
2. Begin Phase 1 tasks below using the new infrastructure
3. Complete remaining database-setup-validation tasks (9-12) during Phase 6

## Development Quality Assurance Hooks

Before starting implementation, create these Kiro Hooks to maintain code quality and version control:

### Hook 1: Code Quality Check (Post-Task Completion)
**Trigger:** After completing any task from this implementation plan
**Purpose:** Ensure code quality, organisation, and alignment with project standards

**Hook Actions:**
- Run PHP CodeSniffer to check coding standards compliance
- Validate database schema changes for proper indexing and relationships
- Check for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS prevention)
- Verify proper error handling and user input validation
- Ensure responsive design works across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Validate accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
- Check performance impact of new code (page load times, database queries)
- Verify proper documentation and code comments

### Hook 2: Git Repository Update (Post-Task Completion)
**Trigger:** After completing any task and passing code quality checks
**Purpose:** Maintain proper version control and deployment readiness

**Hook Actions:**
- Stage all modified and new files
- Create descriptive commit message referencing task number and requirements
- Push changes to main branch (or feature branch if using GitFlow)
- Tag significant milestones (end of each phase)
- Update README.md with new features and setup instructions
- Ensure .gitignore excludes sensitive files (config.php, user uploads)
- Create deployment notes for any database schema changes

### Hook 3: Feature Testing Validation (End of Each Phase)
**Trigger:** Manual trigger at the end of each development phase
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing before moving to next phase

**Hook Actions:**
- Run automated test suite for completed features
- Perform manual testing of user workflows
- Test cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Validate mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
- Check database performance with sample data
- Verify email functionality (registration, newsletters, notifications)
- Test security measures (authentication, authorisation, data protection)
- Document any known issues or limitations
